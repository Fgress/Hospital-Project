# Healthcare Project - T-test on Pediatric patients

This project was conducted with **BC Children's Hospital** to support research on reducing pain during IV insertion in pediatric patients. All dataset details remain confidential. Special thanks to Dr. Louis Scheepers, Investigator and Pediatric Anesthesiologist at BC Children's Hospital, for providing the project data and guidance.

The study compares the effectiveness of **Ametop Gel** versus **Ametop Gel combined with Vapocoolant Spray** in minimizing pain during IV insertions.

## Files included
`06_ametop_final_report.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing the code and analysis.
`06_ametop_final_report.pdf`: A PDF version of the final report generated from the .Rmd file.
`client_presentation.pdf`: A summary of the findings in presentation format.

## Project Overview
1. T-Test Analysis

We conducted a t-test to compare discomfort levels between two groups:
Group 1: Patients treated with Ametop Gel alone.
Group 2: Patients treated with Ametop Gel and Vapocoolant Spray.

Using a significance level, the analysis suggests that the addition of Vapocoolant Spray may reduce discomfort in pediatric patients during IV insertion.

2. Regression Analysis

We performed a regression analysis to assess the importance of various factors, such as age, on pain levels. The results indicated that:

Ametop + Vapocoolant Spray is likely more effective in reducing discomfort in younger children (ages 5-8) compared to older children (ages 9-16).

3. Side Effects Assessment

We also examined potential side effects associated with Ametop Gel and found that it causes no to mild side effects, making it a safe option for pediatric use.
